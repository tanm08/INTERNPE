# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Model

### 🎯 Overview
This project solves the challenge of estimating fair market values for used vehicles. By analyzing features such as mileage, fuel type, and brand, I developed a machine learning model to predict prices with high precision.

### 📊 Key Results
* **R² Score:** 0.89 (Top 11% variance explained)
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.5 Lakhs INR
* **Dataset:** 3,000+ entries cleaned and processed.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Core Logic
* **Pandas/NumPy:** Data Manipulation
* **Scikit-Learn:** Regression Modeling
* **Matplotlib:** Data Visualization

### 🚀 How I Built It
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outlier detection in the dataset.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Converted categorical variables (Fuel Type, Transmission) using One-Hot Encoding.
3.  **Model Selection:** Tested Linear Regression vs. Random Forest.
4.  **Result:** The final model predicts car prices within a narrow margin of error, useful for both buyers and sellers.
